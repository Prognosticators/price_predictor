# House Price Prediction Using Python ( From Scratch )

## Tools used 
- Python 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- github repo = https://github.com/sarangjaiswal/property-rates-india


## Current Idea
- The current idea is to build a real time system that imports data using a web scraper in a csv file. 
- We then use the csv file as a dataframe in python and calculate the regression graph 
    - This graph can be displayed prior to user input ( if required )
- We then accept user input in mode of house location or house size 
- This can then be used to predict the house price currently and the future price of the house. 

## May include
- A way of interacting with the user graphically


## Todo list: ( In Priority Order )
- Set up a program that can accept the input and get the regression table
- Set up the web scraper to give input to program ( timer or on-run )
- Set up multiple parameters ( aim : atleast 3 )
- Set up a GUI for the same ( Non Priority )
